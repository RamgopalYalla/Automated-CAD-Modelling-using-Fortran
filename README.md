# Thin walled Profile Approximation - C++

The Main task of this project is to implement the C++ program to calculate Moment of inertia,
Area and static moment of a given combined profile as shown in Fig. 20 using a thin
walled approximation. From the Fig. 20 it can be seen that the combined profile contains
two Z profiles with same dimensions and One Tube profile and the whole geometry is
symmetric about y axis. These standard profiles (Z and Tube)are taken from standard table
book BautechnischeZahlentafeln26.Auage.The exact values of the individual profiles
are taken directly from the standard table book of European profile.
